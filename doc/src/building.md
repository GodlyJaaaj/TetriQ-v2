# Building from source

You can download the source code from github:
<https://github.com/TetriQ/TetriQ>

## Dependencies

To build TetriQ, you will need the following dependencies:
 - CMake
 - ENet
 - tomlplusplus

Additionally for the client:
 - SFML
 - ncurses

## Building

TetriQ uses the CMake build system, you can easily compile the code
with the following commands:
```
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/ -j
```

You will then find the server and client binaries under the names
`tetriq_server` and `tetriq_client` in your current directory.

## Installing

You can install TetriQ using cmake:
```
cmake --install build
```

You will need to copy the two config files in the `etc/` directory to
a directory searched by TetriQ (seeÂ [Server configuration](./server_configuration.md)).

### Nonstandard directory

You can use the CMake variable `TETRIQ_CONFIG_PATH` to specify the
directory where you installed the two config files. For example, if
you installed them in `/usr/local/etc/tetriq`:
```
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTETRIQ_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/etc/tetriq
```
